meta-labview
------------

This layer adds recipes for LabVIEW and other National Instruments software. 
This software is largely distributed as pre-built binaries, and are provided 
under the National Instruments Software License Agreement.

These recipes will not build by default. In order to build them you need to
enable "National_Instruments_Software_License_Agreement" license by adding 
this line in your local.conf:

LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST += "national-instruments"

A sample local.conf and bblayers.conf is supplied in conf directory.
